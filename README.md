# DeceitDefender - Dark Pattern Buster Hackathon (DPBH)

## What is a Dark Pattern?
Dark patterns are unethical **UI/UX (user interface/user experience)** practices designed to mislead users into actions they donâ€™t intend, such as involuntary subscriptions or hidden charges. These patterns exploit user behavior, undermining transparency and control over their browsing experience.

---

## Problem Statement
Design and prototype innovative app or software-based solutions that can:
- Detect the presence of **dark patterns**.
- Classify their **types** (e.g., bait and switch, disguised advertisements).
- Quantify their **scale** on e-commerce platforms.

---

## Introducing **DeceitDefender**
**DeceitDefender** is a Chrome browser extension built to counteract dark patterns. With a robust combination of **client-side scripting** and **server-side validation**, it:
- Identifies deceptive practices like **basket sneaking**, **drip pricing**, and **disguised advertisements**.
- Monitors user interactions in real time.
- Empowers users through interactive tooltips and feedback mechanisms.

---

## Proposed Solution
Our approach emphasizes simplicity and efficiency, avoiding complex machine learning methodologies. Instead, we leverage:
- **Client-Side Scripting** for real-time detection.
- **Server-Side Validation** for secure and accurate processing.
- **Transparent Design Elements** to build user trust and ensure intuitive navigation.
- **Interactive Feedback Mechanisms** to encourage user participation.

---

## Advantages of DeceitDefender
- **User Privacy**: Aligns with ethical standards, ensuring secure communication.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Combines client-side and server-side technologies.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Covers both client and server sides for robust detection.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily deployable on existing e-commerce platforms.
- **Empowered Users**: Enables users to make informed decisions and report deceptive patterns.

---

## Recognized Dark Patterns
DeceitDefender detects the following patterns:
1. **Disguised Advertisement**: Ads masked as genuine content.
2. **Basket Sneaking**: Hidden charges added to shopping carts.
3. **Bait and Switch**: Promising one thing, delivering another.
4. **Drip Pricing**: Gradual disclosure of additional costs.
5. **Forced Action**: Pressuring users into undesirable actions.

---

## Process Flow
1. **Initialization**:
   - Install the Chrome Extension.
   - Grant necessary permissions.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Content scripts observe user interactions in real time.
   - Chrome Extension APIs facilitate secure data exchange.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Data is processed using **anomaly detection algorithms**.
   - Results are stored in the database.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - A/B testing is conducted to refine detection accuracy.
   - Users receive alerts and reports on detected dark patterns.

5. **Result**:
   - Generates actionable insights for users.
